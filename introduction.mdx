## Setting up

theGPTlab is an open source framework that allows anyone to build, manage, and deploy unique ChatGPT-like AI Assistants.

theGPTlab also provides a cloud platform that allows you to effortlessly deploy AI Assistants in production without worrying about infrastructure, dependencies, or configuration.


## Getting started

The REST API allows you to interact with theGPTlab programmatically and perform various tasks such as creating, updating, and deleting agents. You can also use the API to attach datasources and tools (third-party APIs) to agents.

## Libraries

theGPTlab is available as a REST API and client libraries in Python and TypeScript coming soon.
